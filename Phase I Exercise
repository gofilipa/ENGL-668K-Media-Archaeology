There are six antique computers set up for you to experiment with at MITH. In this, Phase I of the Media Archaeology module, you will learn basic facts about the pedigree of each, figure out how to turn it on (not always obvious!), and perform a few simple tasks to get a feel for how it works. You will work individually for this first phase of the module, logging your activity with each machine via GitHub. (Feel free to ask a classmate for help if you’re genuinely stuck on something, but only after you’ve made an honest effort on your own.) 

For the second phase of the module (to be distributed) you will work in pairs or small groups, choosing one or two computers for a more detailed exploration which may involve building or making something with its original software, and/or doing deeper historical and analytical work. 

You will generally have access to the computers any time MITH is open to the public, which is Mon-Fri, 9-5. Feel free to contact me with any logistical or technical problems. Phase I of this module is due by October 27.

*** Safe Handling ***

Some of these computers are more than three and a half decades old! They built ‘em strong back then so you don’t have to handle them with kid gloves, but please do treat the hardware with respect. To that end:

•	Absolutely no food or drink on the tabletop.
•	Some of the plugs and connections holding everything together are loose or delicate. If a machine doesn’t turn on check that all of its components are snugly plugged and connected, and that there is power going to it. Use common sense to try troubleshooting.
•	Never force anything. If something doesn’t seem to want to work or go or bend or fit, leave it be and ask me.
•	Please keep fingers off of the recording surface of the diskettes. Also keep magnets away!
•	All of the computers except the two Macs can simply be switched off at any point (though you will lose your work unless it’s been saved to a disk). The Macs should always be shut down using the appropriate option under the “Special” heading of the home menu (top of screen).
•	When you turn a computer off, wait about 10 seconds before turning it back on.
•	Please neaten up the workspace around each computer when you finish. Return diskettes to sleeves and holders, stack any books in an orderly fashion, etc.
•	Above all: please remember to turn these computers OFF when you are done with them. Remember, the learning experience for everyone starts with figuring out how to turn them on! Moreover, they won’t go to “sleep” on their own, and whatever is left of their lifespan will be diminished if they are left running.

*** The Exercise ***

For each computer, answer the questions and perform the tasks indicated. Feel free to consult any reference sources you spot around MITH (check the spline!), and/or Wikipedia or other online sources.

Make some additional notes below about each machine as you go: What’s the most notable difference from a computer that you’re used to? Can this computer and its software do anything that your current computer cannot? 

==================================================================================================================
KAYPRO 4

•	What year was it made? 1982
•	What operating system does it run? Control Program by Microcomputers, developed by Digital Research. 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). In 1982, the Kaypro II cost $1,585; adjusted for inflation, that's $3,908.22 today. They are not impossible to find in the second-hand market. There seem to be around a dozen of Kaypro II computers for sale and for auction on eBay, and about half a dozen Kaypro 4 for sale or auction on eBay; however, I did not find any Kaypro models for sale in the Washington DC area on Craigslist. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for? 
The computer was known for its robust software bundle, including word and number processing, and poratble, or "luggable" hardware. Unlike other computers on the market, the Kaypro ran on battery power, had a larger screen, was relatively easy to set up, and offered more options and resources for technical advice. Out of loyalty to its customers, the Kaypro computers continued to use the same CP/M operating system, perhaps to its demise. Because it maintained its existing operating system rather than adapt to IBM PC compatible technology, Kaypro had to file for bankrupsy in 1992.

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Start WordStar (you must figure out how). Try typing a simple document, experimenting with some commands based on the keyboard template. (You don’t need to save your document.)

APPLE IIe

•	What year was it made? 1983
•	What operating system does it run? Apple DOS 3.3 and ProDOS
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). The Apple IIe cost $1,395 in 1982; in today's dollar amount, adjusted for inflation, the price would be $3,332.66. There are a good amount for sale on the second-hand market. I found over a dozen on sale on eBay, and one for sale in the Washington DC area on Craigslist. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
The "e" in Apple IIe stands for "enhanced," meaning that several features which were previously offered as add-ons or upgrades were now built into the computer. This computer was intended for personal and educational use, unlike the Apple III model, which was made for businesses (but failed on the market). On the market for over 10 years with relatively few changes, this computer sold longer than any of Apple's other computers. The most notable new feature was the character set and keyboard, which was ASCII. This model allowed for the input of both uppercase and lowercase letters, four-way cursor control, and the addition of new keys, including the "delete" and "tab" buttons, as well as specialized Apple keys. The model also included a new auxiliary slot for RAM cards, offering more options for memory storage. The design of the computer had a cleaner and more economical motherboard, and the hardware had its own connector so that the user could easily add and remove input devices such as joysticks for gaming. This computer also had a high backwards compatibility with previous Apple models, such as the Apple II, and offered different sized expansion slots. I'm not completely sure, but I think the eventual failure of the computer had to do with it being outsold by IBM, which outsourced its OS to Microsoft. Microsoft's OS, which was on more computers besides just IBM, eventually became more dominant than Apple.     

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Work your way through the Apple Presents Apple tutorial. Try a game or two. (If you can beat one of my high scores on Sea Dragon you’ll get a prize. Really!)

MACINTOSH SE

•	What year was it made? 1987
•	What operating system does it run? Mac OS system software 3.3-3.4; 4.0-6.02; system software 6; and system software 7. 
•	How much did it cost (then and now, adjusted for inflation)? How hard is it to find one on the secondhand market (check eBay and Craig’s List). The basic Apple SE model cost $2,900 in 1987; in today's terms, adjusted for inflation, the price is $6,074.30. There are not at all hard to find on the second-hand market; many are for sale and auction on eBay, though I couldn't find any on Craigslist. 
•	In brief (a short paragraph), what were its historical strengths and weaknesses as a platform? What was it best known for?
"SE" stood for "System Expansion": this was the first compact Macintosh that came with an expansion slot. In addition to the expansion slot, this computer was the first compact Macintosh to offer an internal drive bay for a hard drive or a second floppy disk, as well as a PDS slot to install accelorators. In total, this computer could support three floppy drives. It continued the use of the Apple Desktop Bus, which allowed users to plug in keyboards and mice. It also offered an SCI interface for connecting with other drives, such as hard disk drives and tape drives. Finally, it offered a cooling fan for longer life. Despite all of these features, this computer did not support high density floppy disks. In the Macintosh line, it was eventually replaced by the Microsoft SE/30 and the Microsoft Classic II. 

Turn it on (you must figure out how). Read some of Deena Larsen’s Marble Springs. Quit Marble Springs. What else is on this Mac?
